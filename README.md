Description: When we spend time with our friends and family, we don’t really care what we’re doing as long as we’re hanging out with the people we love. Meet Me Halfway saves you the trouble of choosing what to do when you just want to spend time with someone. When you want to hang out with a friend, Meet Me Halfway takes your locations, and using Yelp, Esri, and Facebook APIs, suggests points of interest that are within reasonable distance to both of you. You’ll save time, trouble, and even gas, all while getting closer to your friends.
